# PetShare Application Blueprint

## Overview

PetShare is a social media application designed for pet lovers to share photos and stories of their furry friends. The platform provides a space for users to connect, interact, and celebrate their pets.

## Implemented Features

### Styling and Design
- **Core Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for a utility-first styling approach.
- **Layout**: The application features a clean, centered layout that is responsive and user-friendly.

### User Authentication
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication is implemented, allowing users to sign up and log in using their email and password.
- **Error Handling**: The authentication forms provide clear error messages for failed login or signup attempts.
- **Routing**: React Router is configured to manage navigation, with a protected route for the main feed that requires users to be logged in.

## Development Plan

### Current Task: Implement Authentication and Basic Routing

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Add `react-router-dom` to the project for handling client-side routing.
2.  **Create Authentication Component**:
    *   Develop `AuthPage.jsx` to provide both sign-up and login functionality.
    *   The component will include a form that switches between "Sign Up" and "Login" modes.
    *   Firebase Authentication will be used to handle user creation and sign-in.
    *   The form will have robust error handling to display relevant messages to the user (e.g., "Invalid email," "Wrong password").
3.  **Set Up Application Routing**:
    *   Create a main `App.jsx` file to define the application's routes.
    *   Implement a public route for the authentication page (`/`).
    *   Create a protected route for the main feed (`/feed`), which will only be accessible after a successful login.
4.  **Develop the Main Feed**:
    *   Create a placeholder `Feed.jsx` component to serve as the landing page after login.
5.  **Update Project Entry Point**:
    *   Modify `main.jsx` to render the new routing structure.
